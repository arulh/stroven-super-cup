## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 16+
- npm or yarn
- Backend API running on localhost:8000

### Installation
```bash
# Navigate to frontend directory
cd frontend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm start
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`

### Backend Integration
The frontend expects the backend API to be running on `http://localhost:8000` with the following endpoints:

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

### Database Schema Additions
To fully support the new frontend features, consider adding these database fields:

#### Players Table Extensions
```sql
ALTER TABLE players ADD COLUMN profile_photo VARCHAR(255);
ALTER TABLE players ADD COLUMN description TEXT;
ALTER TABLE players ADD COLUMN current_streak INTEGER DEFAULT 0;
ALTER TABLE players ADD COLUMN streak_type VARCHAR(10) DEFAULT 'none';
ALTER TABLE players ADD COLUMN best_win_streak INTEGER DEFAULT 0;
ALTER TABLE players ADD COLUMN worst_loss_streak INTEGER DEFAULT 0;
```

#### New Tables for Advanced Analytics
```sql
-- Player performance metrics
CREATE TABLE player_metrics (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    player_id INTEGER REFERENCES players(id),
    metric_name VARCHAR(50),
    metric_value FLOAT,
    calculated_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- Match analytics
CREATE TABLE match_analytics (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    match_id INTEGER REFERENCES matches(id),
    player_id INTEGER REFERENCES players(id),
    goals_scored INTEGER,
    goals_conceded INTEGER,
    possession_percentage FLOAT,
    shots_on_target INTEGER,
    defensive_actions INTEGER
);
```

### API Enhancements
Additional endpoints to support advanced features:
- `GET /api/rivalries` - Head-to-head statistics
- `GET /api/streaks` - Current streak information
- `GET /api/player/{handle}/form` - Recent form data
- `GET /api/analytics/performance` - Performance radar data
- `GET /api/analytics/activity` - Match frequency patterns
- `POST /api/player/{handle}/profile` - Update profile information

### Feature Roadmap
- [ ] Real-time match updates via WebSocket
- [ ] Player profile editing interface
- [ ] Tournament bracket visualization
- [ ] Advanced statistical filters
- [ ] Export functionality for charts
- [ ] Mobile app version
- [ ] Social sharing features

## 🎮 Mock Data

The current implementation uses mock data for demonstration. In production:
- Rivalries data calculated from match history
- Streaks computed from consecutive match results
- Performance metrics derived from detailed match analytics
- Activity patterns aggregated from match timestamps

## 🚦 Running the Full System

1. **Start Backend API**:
   ```bash
   docker compose up -d --build
   ```

2. **Start Frontend**:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
